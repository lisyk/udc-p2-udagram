Infrastructure elements:
  - VPC
  - Private subnets in two AZ
  - Internet Gateways
  - S3 bucket
  - IAM Role for EC2 to use S3
  - Launch configuration (2 x vCPUs, RAM 4GB, HHD 10GB, OS Ubuntu 18)
  - Auto Scalling group
Udagram communicates on the default HTTP Port: 80
so servers need this inbound port open since it will be used with the Load Balancer 
and the Load Balancer Health Check. 
As for outbound, the servers will need unrestricted internet access 
to be able to download and update its software.

The load balancer should allow all public traffic (0.0.0.0/0) on port 80 inbound, 
which is the default HTTP port. 
Outbound, it will only be using port 80 to reach the internal servers.

The application needs to be deployed into private subnets with a Load Balancer located in a public subnet.

Output the public URL of the LoadBalancer.

Add http:// in front of the load balancer DNS Name in the output.

**********************
This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets spread 
across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default 
route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ), 
and default routes for them in the private subnets.
